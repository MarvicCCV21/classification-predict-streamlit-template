Data fluent inc. is a world-class data science company that specializes 
in extracting useful insights from all kinds of raw data. 
Data collection and analysis are increasingly becoming very useful in industries and economies worldwide. 
With advances in science and technology (particularly information technology), we are in an age 
where an astounding quantity of data in many different forms is generated every second. 
This data usually have hidden within them insights on trends, habits, developments, changes, etc that may not be immediately identified.


Before now, it was near impossible to process these large swaths of data in order to reveal these insights. With the developments in the field 
of data science and the expertise of a company like ours,
 these data can be processed to not only reveal the insight hidden in them but to also present the discoveries 
 made in the process in a form that is digestible by a non-technical audience. Our team is made up of 5 highly qualified professionals 
 who excel in the fields of **Business Management, marketing and promotions, technical data science, IT communications, 
 and Administration**. Please refer to this link to access our full company profile.

The emphasis on the burden of climate change has been constantly expanding to include personal responsibility rather 
than general by huge companies and Governments alone. It is increasingly obvious that action needs to be taken on 
personal levels to combat climate change and its attendant effects. Many companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s 
environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and 
sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. This model can help these companies achieve their goals by 
providing access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - 
thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies as we would show.

<h3>Data Details</h3>				
<h4 style="text-align:justify; line-height:150%; color: black; ">	
					  
The quality of a model is only as good as the quality of data used to generate it. 
To produce our models, we must first select an appropriate set of data for training 
that has been annotated. The data collection used for the development of this model 
was funded by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation JELF Grant to Chris Bauch, University 
of Waterloo. The dataset aggregates tweets pertaining to climate change collected between 
Apr 27, 2015, and Feb 21, 2018. In total, 43943 tweets. Each tweet is labeled as one of the following classes:

<h3>Class Description</h3>
<ul type="A" style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li><span>2 NEWS:* the tweet links to factual news about climate change</span></li>
  <li><span>1 PRO: the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change</span></li>
  <li><span>0 NEUTRAL: the tweet neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change</span></li>
  <li><span> -1 ANTI: the tweet does not believe in man-made climate change</span></li>
  
</ul>	


<h3>Variable definitions</h3>
<ul type="A" style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li><span>sentiment: Sentiment of a tweet</span></li>
  <li><span>message: Tweet body</span></li>
  <li><span>sentiment: Sentiment of a tweet</span></li>

<h3>Model goals</h3> 
<h4 style="text-align:justify; line-height:130%; color: black;">

This model aims to explore machine learning as a method to assist us in identifying whether or not a person 
believes in climate change and ascertain if such a person could be converted to a new customer for an 
environmentally conservative product based on their tweets. Our  ML models are capable of classifying 
tweets into any of 4 categories as detailed below. </h4> 
 
<h3>Model performance</h3/>  
<h4 style="text-align:justify; line-height:130%; color: black;">

Our model performance is gauged using the F1 score. 
This Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. 
The F1 score is the industry standard for measuring the accuracy of a classification model as it takes both 
false positives and false negatives into account.  
 F1 is usually more useful than accuracy, especially if you have an uneven class distribution. 
The F1 score for the models we deployed here ranges from 0.76 to 0.88.
